Based on my experience, the only thing i can remember is that you cannot use fragments in the "server side", i.e gatsby-node.js out of the box, they are reserved for "client side" (components/pages) all my experiments with fragments in gatsby-node.js resulted in build errors. A workaround is to write them yourself, if you're willing take a look at the gatsby-transformer-sharp plugin and see how it's built and if it helps
