Started and completely built a tool called "Loop Now" which is an agile web application to control and monitor feedback in a company.

It gives you a complete survey functionality to display insights of your company inn several ways to find out what and where to improve.
Technically I improved the build speed and the development process also extended the core functionality of the frontend with new features and technologies.
I worked in a agile enviroment on a very complex and big project. We managed to tranfer the whole frontend application, written in React to Typescript and kept the bundlesize and the loading time of the project to a minimum. Additionally I  got some insights about backend technologies and how set up and maintain a complex api. I also was involved in the hiring and onboarding process process of new developers and interns.
