Started and entirely built a tool called "Loop Now" which is an agile web application to control and monitor feedback in your company.

It gives you an easy to use and intuitive survey functionality to display insights of your company in several custom ways to find out what and where to improve.
Technically I improved the build speed and the development process and also created and extended the core functionality of the frontend with new features and technologies.
I worked in a agile enviroment on a very complex and big project. We managed to tranfer the whole frontend application, written in React to Typescript and kept the bundlesize and the loading time of the project to a minimum. Additionally I got some insights about backend technologies and how set up and maintain a complex api. I also was involved in the hiring and onboarding process process of new developers and interns.
