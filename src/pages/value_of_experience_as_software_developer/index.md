When you have searched for a job you will most definitely being asked about your experience with software development and
almost every job description for searching a software developer includes the following line

> You need at least X+ years of professional experience working as a X-developer for this position.

Or it might even include answering for every programming language tool or framework how much experience you have . I even heard from huge excel sheets you have to fill out for every technology the years you have worked with it.

But what exactly is this mysterious experience? Can you count it ? Do you have reference for it? Is it just the simple years you have worked so far?

Let's dig into it.

## Defining Experience

Most of the companies define or value experience in number of years. For example having 5 years experience working as a software developer makes you a senior developer with more than ten you can become a manager.

But is it really that simple? Sitting there counting the years and earning more and more experience?
With that analogy you will be the best developer in the last year before retirement and the only thing you have to do is to sit and wait to get better and better.

For a better understanding of what experience really is, it is important to divide it into "Technical Experience" and "Softskill Experience"

### Technical Experience

As a software developer you will always have to learn new things, the tools we are working with changes so fast that it is important to always sharpen your view with the current trends and new methods or technologies and with that having experience working with a technology from 5 or even 3 years ago is often not as valueable as the experience you get working with the current technologies.

So imagine you worked 10 years as a software developer and then you went for a 5 years trip around the world without reading or touching any code. Does your 10 years of technical experience have the same value as someone working in the last 5 years? Probably not.

#### Understanding the context

Let's say one developer has worked over 5 years with a huge codebase that exists even before you started working on it. You did you best to add new things to it, to refactor some things or to understand some legacy code.
Another one works at an agency or as a freelancer
