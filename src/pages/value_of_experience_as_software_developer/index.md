When you have searched for a job you will most definitely being asked about your experience with software development and
almost every job description for searching a software developer includes the following line

> You need at least X+ years of professional experience working as a X-developer for this position.

Or it might even include answering for every programming language tool or framework how much experience you have.
I even heard from huge excel sheets, where you have to fill out for every technology the years you have worked with it.

But is it really that simple? What exactly is this mysterious experience? Can you count it ? Do you have reference for it? Is it just the simple years you have worked so far?

Let's dig into it.

### Gaining Experience

Most of the companies define or value experience in number of years. For example having 5 years experience working as a software developer makes you a senior developer with more than ten you can become a manager.

So why are we not then only sitting there counting the years and earning more and more experience?
With that analogy you will be the best developer in the last year before retirement and the only thing you have to do is to sit and wait to get better and better.

## Defining Experience

For a better understanding of what experience really is, it is important to divide it into "Technical Experience" and "Everything else than technical Experience"

### Technical Experience

As a software developer you will always have to learn new things, the tools we are working with changes so fast that it is important to always sharpen your view with the current trends and new methods or technologies. With that having experience working with a technology from 5 or even 3 years ago is often not as valueable as the experience you get working with the current technologies.

So imagine you worked 10 years as a software developer and then you went for a 5 years trip around the world without reading or touching any code. Does your 10 years of technical experience have the same value as someone working in the last 5 years? Probably not.

#### Understanding the context

Let's say one developer has worked over 5 years with a huge codebase that exists even before you started working on it. You did you best to add new things to it, to refactor some things or to understand some legacy code.
Another one works at an agency or as a freelancer and contributed or created multiple different projects with different scopes. Even though its in the same field or the technology was even the same both developers gained rather different experience.

One type of experience is how to work and maintain a big project and how to work legacy code, the other one is more experience with setting up projects and being able to identify the balance between quality and speed.

#### It depends on the motivation

This is probably the most overlooked point of what experience is made of.
You can be either the developer who is always curious and always open to try out learn new things and willing to step out of the comfort zone or you can be a one trick pony developer who knows one thing quite good and you always do only that because that is what you know.

But at the end of the day you will have the same years of experience, but the actual knowledge and _experience_ you've gained are completely different.

### Everything but technical experience

We all know it, working as a software developer includes mostly also working with other people or mostly working with inside a team. So one thing you will realize quite quickly is that one big part of having experience is how to deal with working as a team, planing, communicating and mentoring. Those things is not something you can learn by reading a book or an article. Those things come with job. Probably this is the case where experience is the most valueable ressource. But is again time here the best measurement?

Let's think of someone working in a team of rather less people and the fluctuation is quite low, which means everyone works together for years. Is that experience they all have easily applyable for other teams? Or is it experience really bound to that specific company or team?
Wouldn't be someone who has worked in the same time withing multiple different teams or companies with various sizes more experienced in that regards?

#### Getting insights

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying everyone should switch companies or teams every 3 months, I just would argue that you can get easily into somekind of comfort zone working always with the same people and you get used to the workflows without getting new input. When new input and stepping out of the comfort zone is actually gaingin experience the best way.

Especially when it comes to non-technical things, as you mostly cannot read or learn them with ressources available the only thing to get new insights is to talk or work with new people. So maybe another measurement except time for defining experience in that sense would make more sense.

### Conclusion

When you for example work as a simple salesman going from door to door selling vacuum cleaners, there is one simple measurement of how good you work, its the number of items you sell, For them it's that simple. That's why you start from any point working in that field you can directly being the best one, by just selling more items.

But I think when it comes to judging experience or value of developers it's not that simple and since software development is such a wide spreaded job, it's nearly impossible to find _that_ way of doing it.
That's why the most used one is currently just the simple time of working experience.
But since it's obviously not so easy to define it, why are we then using such a simple measurement? Can we not make the definition a bit more detailed than just a simple number?

If someone would spend the whole workday write one line of the same javascript code over and over again, for 5 years, would that make him/her a developer with 5 years of experience of javascript?
Yes, but would that make him/her a good javascript developer?
No not really.

So I think we need somehow a better way of understand the real value of experience as a software developer and especially when it comes to recruitment there must be a way of identifying it instead of just counting down the number of years.
